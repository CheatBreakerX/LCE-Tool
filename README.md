<p align="center">work in progress port of mcctoolchest to an open source, crossplatform, webapp using fluent svelte</p>

## How to run
Currently there is no installer, so you have to run it from the dev environment. You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
   ```bash
   npm install --global yarn
   ```
3. Initialise the project
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
5. Run the application
   ```bash
   yarn electron-dev
   ```
Keep in mind, most changes you make get recompiled on the fly so you do not always have to restart the application after making a change.
